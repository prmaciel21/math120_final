# Math 120 Python Final: Facial Recognition with PCA

## Project Overview
This Python project investigates facial recognition by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce image dimensionality and extract meaningful facial features. A classification model is then trained on these reduced representations to distinguish individuals based on their facial images. The project includes dataset preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation of recognition performance.
